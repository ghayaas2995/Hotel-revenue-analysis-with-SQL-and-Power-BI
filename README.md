# Hotel-revenue-analysis-with-SQL-and-Power-BI

The research questions answered by performing analysis on the hotel sales data are:

1. We have two hotel types in the data. Is the revenue increasing year on year with respect to these two hotel types? It was observed that there was an uptrend increase in the revenue of hotels year on year.

2. Understand the trend of customers with their personal cars and to determine if the hotel needs to increase parking size. I observed that the existing parking space was sufficient for the number of incoming personal cars by the guests and there was no need to further increase parking space at hotels.

3. Other trends in the data with special focus on average daily rate of hotel and guests to explore seasonality.
